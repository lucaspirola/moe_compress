# Retire `ALGORITHM_REFERENCE.md` — transfer info into plugin docstrings

Branch: `feat/algorithm-reference-retirement` (off `main` @ `febc13f`)
Source doc: `max_quality/ALGORITHM_REFERENCE.md` (~1050 lines) — **consumable**
Goal: every plugin file becomes **self-contained** — a reviewer reading only
the plugin file (module docstring + class docstring + `paper` field) knows:
  1. What paper(s) the plugin implements (with arXiv ID + section/equation),
     **cross-verified against the local paper text in `audit/spec_compliance/01_papers/<arxiv_id>/source.md`**.
  2. When the paper has officially-released code, the **golden implementation
     reference** with the **exact commit SHA**.
  3. What deviations from the paper the implementation makes, with the spec's
     justification preserved.
  4. The key formulas / hyperparameters the plugin uses.

After this task: `ALGORITHM_REFERENCE.md` is **deleted**. No surviving file may
link to it.

## Policy — consumable source doc

As each plugin is updated, the corresponding text in `ALGORITHM_REFERENCE.md` is
**surgically removed**. The doc's residual size shrinks monotonically; an empty
file at the end of Phase 7 = 100% of the information was transferred.

When a passage is **shared by multiple plugins** (e.g., the §5 covariance side-
collection block consumed by both Stage 2 plugins and Stage 3 plugins), it is
**marked** rather than deleted, with a `<!-- SHARED — re-check at end -->` HTML
comment, and resolved in Phase 9 once we know which plugin "owns" it.

## Policy — paper cross-check

For each plugin's citations:
  * **Paper line refs** (e.g., "Algorithm 1 line 8") MUST be verified against
    `audit/spec_compliance/01_papers/<arxiv_id>/source.md`. The source.md
    line numbers and the paper's PDF line/§ numbers may differ — use the
    `source.md` (project-canonical) numbering.
  * **Claims attributed to the paper** that are NOT in `source.md` must be
    treated as suspect — never silently drop them. **Run git archaeology**
    (`git log --all -p -S "<value>"` on the relevant file, including the
    pre-refactor monoliths) to find the origin: many "paper" values turn
    out to be project's earlier empirical calibrations encoded into source
    code, then mis-attributed by `ALGORITHM_REFERENCE.md` to the paper.
    Preserve full project history (commit SHAs of the introduction and any
    later changes) in the plugin's docstring.
  * When a paper has officially-released code, fetch the **default-branch HEAD
    SHA** via `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/commits/HEAD --jq .sha` and pin it
    in the docstring. Cross-check the relevant code paths against the
    pinned SHA — many "paper says X" claims turn out to be "official code
    says X" claims (and vice versa). Re-verify the SHA only if the upstream
    repo's behaviour changes; otherwise the pinned SHA is the golden
    reference.

**Worked example (ma_detection):** ALGORITHM_REFERENCE.md said *"the paper's
5.0 calibration applies"* for un-gated architectures. The paper has no 5.0;
the official code has no 5.0 either (it uses only the 0.75 depth heuristic).
Git archaeology found 5.0 introduced in commit `3db7d80` (as an
"implementation choice"), confirmed as the production value on Qwen3-30B in
`40956e3`, then recalibrated to 3.0 for Qwen3.5/3.6 in `172e72e`. Truth:
both 5.0 and 3.0 are project-original empirical calibrations attested by
git history; ALGORITHM_REFERENCE.md was wrong to attribute 5.0 to the paper.
The redone ma_detection docstring preserves the full archaeology.

## Policy — Phase A/B/C/D/E/F labels

**Dropped from new docstrings.** The Phase taxonomy was a project-internal
organising scheme grounded in `ALGORITHM_REFERENCE.md`'s sections; once the
doc is deleted, the taxonomy loses its centralised definition. The orchestrator's
dependency ordering is the real load-bearing structure, and it is already
encoded in plugins' `reads`/`writes` declarations.

* **Existing code** (variable names like `_PHASE_A_BATCH_SIZE`, log messages
  like `"Stage 1 Phase A: ..."`) is left alone — renaming is a separate
  refactor with operational risk (Trackio dashboards).
* **New docstrings** describe plugins by their concern (e.g., "MA-formation
  layer detection", not "Phase A").

## Surface area

**Files that link to `ALGORITHM_REFERENCE.md` directly** (must be cleansed):
- `stage1/plugins/ma_detection.py` ← also has the wrong `paper` field
- `stage1/plugins/ablation_filter.py`
- `stage1/plugins/magnitude_topk.py`
- `stage2/resume.py`
- `budget_retune.py`
- `budget/solver.py`
- `utils/cov_sqrt.py`

**Plugin files that need docstring enrichment** (full per-plugin spec inline):
- Stage 1: 8 plugins
- Stage 2: 17 plugins
- Stage 3: 5 plugins
- Stage 4: 2 plugins
- Router-KD: 6 plugins
- Stage 6: 8 plugins
- Stage 6alt: 6 plugins
- Total: 52 plugin files

## Plugin × paper × deviation map (Stage 6alt — thermometer)

**Not in `ALGORITHM_REFERENCE.md`.** Stage 6alt's spec is self-contained in
`stage6alt_thermometer.py`'s module docstring. Phase 7 is a sanity sweep — no
info-transfer needed.

| Plugin | Concern |

## Non-plugin files to cleanse (Phase 8)

These reference `ALGORITHM_REFERENCE.md` in comments / docstrings but are not
plugins — their cleansing is straightforward:

- `stage2/resume.py`
- `budget_retune.py`
- `budget/solver.py`
- `utils/cov_sqrt.py`

## Execution plan

- [x] Phase 0: branch `feat/algorithm-reference-retirement` from `main` @ `febc13f`
- [ ] Phase 1 (Stage 1, 8 plugins) — one commit per plugin; consume `ALGORITHM_REFERENCE.md` per plugin
- [ ] Phase 2 (Stage 2, 17 plugins)
- [ ] Phase 3 (Stage 3, 5 plugins)
- [ ] Phase 4 (Stage 4, 2 plugins)
- [ ] Phase 5 (Router-KD, 6 plugins)
- [ ] Phase 6 (Stage 6, 8 plugins)
- [ ] Phase 7 (Stage 6alt, 6 plugins — sanity sweep only)
- [ ] Phase 8 — cleanse non-plugin files
- [ ] Phase 9 — resolve any `SHARED — re-check at end` markers in
       `ALGORITHM_REFERENCE.md`; confirm doc is empty modulo title/footer
- [ ] Phase 10 — delete `ALGORITHM_REFERENCE.md` (own atomic commit); sweep for
       any remaining `ALGORITHM_REFERENCE` reference
- [ ] Phase 11 — full test suite green

## Verification gate per commit

* Plugin's own tests + the stage golden test green.
* `grep -r ALGORITHM_REFERENCE max_quality/src/<plugin-stage>/` returns nothing
  for that plugin.
* `grep -F "<consumed text>" max_quality/ALGORITHM_REFERENCE.md` returns
  nothing (proves the surgical deletion landed).

## End-of-task verification

* `ls -la max_quality/ALGORITHM_REFERENCE.md` returns "No such file or directory".
* `grep -r ALGORITHM_REFERENCE max_quality/` returns nothing.
* `pytest max_quality/tests/` green.
