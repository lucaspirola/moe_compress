"""Greedy assignment solver (Task 13 of the plugin-architecture refactor).

Plugin home for ``_assign_greedy`` — the legacy descending-saliency greedy
assignment path. Extracted verbatim from ``stage2_reap_ream`` in Task 13.

This is the **leaf** of the solver import DAG: it imports nothing from the
sibling solver modules (greedy never falls back to another solver). The other
solvers (``solver_mcf``, ``solver_sinkhorn``) import ``_assign_greedy`` from
here as their fallback path; ``solver_dispatch`` re-exports it via the registry.

The monolith re-imports ``_assign_greedy`` so external callers (tests, the
``MOE_STAGE2_LEGACY_LOOP=1`` path, ``LegacyAdapter``) keep their import paths.

``GreedySolverPlugin`` is a scaffold-only plugin — not yet on the live
phase walk (the bump loop still calls ``_assign_children_to_centroids``); it
gives T18 a per-solver plugin to wire into the decomposed ``solve_assignment``
phase. Circular-import note: this module imports only ``pipeline.base`` and
``pipeline.context``, neither of which imports ``stage2_reap_ream``.
