"""Stage 3 — Non-uniform SVD, fused-experts-aware.

At this point each MoE layer still has a fused ``Qwen3_5MoeExperts`` but with
``num_experts = N'_l`` (post-prune). We:

1. Compute per-group statistics (D-Rank) over banks.
2. Choose per-group uniform rank ``k_g`` via D-Rank allocation targeting
   the global ``T_budget`` derived from ``decomposition.svd_rank_ratio``.
3. Swift-SVD+ α selection via WikiText-2 PPL validation (paper 2604.01609,
   §3.2.2). For each α ∈ {0.0, ..., 1.0}, factor the full model at the
   corresponding per-expert ranks and evaluate end-to-end perplexity on a
   validation set; pick the α with lowest PPL. Falls back to spectral
   energy proxy when ``validation_samples=0``.
4. For each layer, **factor every expert at the chosen group rank**
   via AA-SVD using the Stage-2 covariance and a fresh pruned-model
   calibration. Install a :class:`FactoredExperts` in place of the fused module.
5. Per-matrix activation-weighted L-BFGS refine on (U, V) pairs.

Uniform per-group rank lets us keep all factored banks as clean stacked
tensors of shape ``[N, d_out, k]`` and ``[N, k, d_in]`` — no padding.
